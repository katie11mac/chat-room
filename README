Known Bugs: 
- Cannot handle multiple clients 
- Does not properly print the username of client
- When a singular client sends more than one message, there is a significant lag in printing the message

Questions
- having multiple threads at the same time (join/mutexes)
- keeping track of multiple threads

- multi threaded program: main is running in it’s own thread 

sending messages to all clients
- sends to all fds 
- need to keep track of all fds (need to iterate through all of them) - linked lists of client structs
	- fd and name of thread (modify them)
	- need to delete them (need to check what we’re receiving (return 0 or -1) in the child thread) 
	- add new ones (new connection in main thread) 
	- THIS IS WHERE MUTEXES come into play (data structure being modified by different threads) 
	- Modifications make this game very careful
	- Reads have to protected from modifications 
- Every function needs a mutex 
- there is only one resource we want to protect (one thread can access one resource at a time) 
- one mutex for each of the resources
